The extra files fit_stim.csv and real_wav.csv are too large to upload to GitHub.

They can be found on Google drive at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FV4N2I41FAlbWF5hjTtf1xWhJroCqDur?usp=sharing

Be careful not to upload this data to GitHub when submitting your project. GitHub will get upset and you will have to do fancy things to revert your attempted commit.
